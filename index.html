        <!-- Intro / About -->
        <div class="section" id="about">
            <h2>How It All Began</h2>
            <p>
                I’m transitioning into cybersecurity with a focus on 
                <strong>Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)</strong>, especially in the healthcare space. 
                What started as curiosity about how systems, data, and regulations work together has grown 
                into a deliberate path toward helping organizations manage risk and protect sensitive information.
            </p>
            <p>
                This page documents my learning journey, certifications, and hands-on projects as I develop 
                the skills needed to support secure, compliant environments.

            <h2>📅 My Cybersecurity Timeline</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>September 2024 – HIPAA Compliance Assessment</strong><br>
                    Participated in a departmental <strong>HIPAA compliance assessment</strong>,  
                    which gave me my first structured exposure to healthcare regulations, PHI handling, and 
                    the importance of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>December 2024 – Google Cybersecurity Certificate</strong><br>
                    Completed the <strong>Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate</strong>, 
                    gaining foundational skills in security concepts, incident response, SIEM tools, and threat analysis.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>January 2025 – CompTIA Security+</strong><br>
                    Earned the <strong>CompTIA Security+</strong> certification, solidifying my understanding of 
                    core security domains including network security, identity and access management, and risk management.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>March 2025 – Intensive GRC Training & Mentor</strong><br>
                    Committed to a <strong>6-month intensive GRC training</strong> while building my first portfolio projects.  
                    During this period, I also met a <strong>cybersecurity mentor</strong> who helped me see how my strengths 
                    in analysis, documentation, and communication align well with GRC roles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>November 2025 – ISACA CISA</strong><br>
                    Obtained the <strong>Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA)</strong> certification, 
                    deepening my skills in IT auditing, control design, and risk-based thinking—key for GRC and 
                    governance work in regulated industries like healthcare.

        <!-- Training & Focus -->
        <div class="section" id="training">
            <h2>🎯 Focus: GRC & Healthcare</h2>
            <p>
                My long-term goal is to specialize in <strong>GRC for healthcare environments</strong>. 
                I’m particularly interested in:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>HIPAA and other healthcare-specific regulations.</li>
                <li>Risk assessments and risk registers for healthcare applications and workflows.</li>
                <li>Security awareness and policy development for non-technical staff.</li>
                <li>Using frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001, COBIT) to guide security and compliance programs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As part of my portfolio, I’m building a <strong>healthcare-themed GRC project</strong> 
                that documents around a dozen realistic risks for a fictional company, 
                <strong>CompEx Healthcare</strong>, along with suggested controls and mitigations.
